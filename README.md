# Coding-2.0
All of the random pieces of code I've written

## What is this?
This is all my scripts that I've written. I decided to publish them on Github so I could collaborate with others.

## What can I do here?
Adding your own scripts that you've written would be fun. You can also look through the TODOs that are in a lot of the scripts. Much of the code I've written isn't finished. Some is abandoned and some are projects that I'm still working on. Your help finishing them would be terrific.
